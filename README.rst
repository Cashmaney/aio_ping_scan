My attempt at making a ping scanner using python.

Why you ask? (There must be a better language to use!) -- because there didn't seem to be a good tool out there, and I
figured it would be a good learning experience.

Packet building is in cython, scanning is done in multiprocessing using async scans.

** If you're reading this the code is highly unstable, not recommended in production, and not optimized **
